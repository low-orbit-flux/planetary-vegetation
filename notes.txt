- need support for mongodb authentication ( user, password )
- fix this:
    "WARNING - more followers exist, update code to handle these"




- BUG - not showing people I unfollowed

- get content feeds working
- use hash tags in the content feed

- add users, should use mutliple keywords and zip the lists together

- need long running follow/unfollow jobs

- more twitter accounts




store existing followers
    - check if already there, update or create

store existing friends
    - check if already there, update or create

unfollow query
    -query friends who aren't followers
        - compare date
        - print

unfollow
    - query friends who aren't followers
        - compare date
        - SLOWLY loop to unfollow, cap MAX unfollows

follow
    - search for relevant people
        - check if they are on the list already ( this will cover unfollowed people )
        - SLOWLY Follow,  CAP Max follows




def follow_user():
    - check if already in twitter-users table   ( already following or unfollowed )
    - actually follow
        - on success add to twitter-users table with current DATE/TIME












Cache:
    potential   id, name         ( random unfiltered names )
